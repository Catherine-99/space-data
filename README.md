<h2>About the Project</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This website is a personal project that displays data and images sourced from multiple NASA APIs, including the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), 
  Mars Rover Photos, and the Daily Observations of Near-Earth Object (DONKI) API.<br> <br> The aim of this project was to familiarise myself with the use of APIs, 
asynchronous Javascript, and translating a Figma design into a functional website with accessibility and responsive features.</p>

<p>Visitors of the website can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View the astronomy photo of the day and its description</li>
  <li>View random Mars Rover photos and read information about when each picture was taken and by which camera</li>
  <li>View information on recent space events such as solar flares</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Built With</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>NASA APIs (APOD API, Mars Rover Photos API, DONKI API)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Website Design</h3>
<p>Below is a screenshot of the Figma design file used as a reference for this website.
The design was created by myself to visualise the layout and colour scheme of the website before coding.</p>
